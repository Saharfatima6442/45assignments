//Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var pNames = ["Muniza", "Kiran", "Ayesha"];
var message = "Hi, Please take out some time and plan a meetup";
console.log("\n" + "".concat(pNames[1], ", ").concat(message)); //we can change number in array too for consoling msg for other frnds
