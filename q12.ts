//Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let pNames:string[] = ["Muniza", "Kiran", "Ayesha"];
let message = "Hi, Please take out some time and plan a meetup";

console.log("\n"+`${pNames[1]}, ${message}`);//we can change number in array too for consoling msg for other frnds
